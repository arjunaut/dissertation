1. API calls to call HH generation data from balancing units
2. i) Compiles plant data - location, fuel type, dno area ii) Merges plant data  to generation data in folder 1 iii) calculate estimated emissions per hh, per plant
iv) calculate estimated emissions per hh, per dno region (excluding embedded generation)
3. hh demand, measured as group take per region - (imports/exports via Grid Supply Points, imports/exports via  inter DSO connections, and imports via embedded generation). aggregation rules on p.28: https://www.elexon.co.uk/documents/training-guidance/bsc-guidance-notes/aggregation-rules/
